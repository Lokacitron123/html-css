# HTML & CSS Folder for Design Purposes Using CSS

This folder contains my HTML and CSS practice projects.  
The goal of this setup is to focus purely on **CSS and design**, without worrying about JavaScript or functionality.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

I created this folder to:

- Improve my CSS skills.
- Experiment with layouts, animations, and responsive design.
- Explore modern CSS features and styling techniques.
- Build visually appealing pages without backend or interactivity.

## ðŸ§± Structure

Each project lives in its own subfolder and usually includes:

- `index.html` â€” main HTML file
- `styles.css` â€” main stylesheet
- `assets/` â€” optional folder for images, icons, or other resources

## ðŸ§  Notes

- No frameworks or preprocessors are used â€” just plain **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Focus is on **design, layout, and styling**.
- Perfect for experimenting and improving visual creativity.

## ðŸš€ Future Plans

As I progress, I might:

- Recreate real-world websites for practice.
- Try out design systems and accessibility improvements.
- Add simple interactivity later using JavaScript or frameworks.
